First Website Project

October 14. 2021- This was my first HTML project.
Setting the html boiler plate was easy.
Had some trouble with the relative links.
Still not really sure how the relative links really work. 
Looking foward styling and adding JavaScript.

November 18. 2021- Made some upgrades. Added Internal CSS.
I am almost at the flexbox chapter.
