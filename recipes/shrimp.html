        <h2>Shrimp Fetuccine Alfredo</h2>    
        </p>

        <p>
        Fettuccine alfredo is one of life's greatest comfort foods. It's creamy, cheesy, carb-y,
         and super flavorful. The shrimp adds lots of extra flavor and some lean protein to boot!   
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fetuccine</li>
                <li>Shrimp</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>

        </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook fettucine according to the instructions on the box, reserving a cup of pasta water to 
                    thicken the sauce.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon butter until melted. Add shrimp ,
                    season with pepper and salt and cook until pink and completely opaque.
                </li>
                <li>Into the pan, add remaining 2 tablespoons butter and garlic. Cook until the garlic becomes fragrant,
                    about 1 minute. Whisk in flour and cook until no longer raw, 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream and milk, then whisk in egg yolk.
                    Bring to a low simmer and whisk in parmesan. When cheese is melted and sauce has thickened slightly, add cooked pasta and shrimp,
                    tossing to combine. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Garnish with more parmesan and parsley</li>
